            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2 mb-8 ml-4">
                With the rapid advancements in multi-agent systems, challenges such as efficient V2X communication, cooperative policy learning, real-time data sharing, and scalable decision-making remain open. Additionally, the integration of multi-robot semantic perception and large language models (LLMs) presents new opportunities for improved scene understanding and adaptive cooperation in dynamic environments. The objective of this workshop is to explore the intersection of multi-agent cooperative systems, swarm robotics, and generative AI, fostering discussions on how foundation models, generative models, and cooperative intelligence can enhance perception, planning, decision-making, and communication in multi-robot and autonomous systems.
                This workshop will bring together researchers, practitioners, and industry experts to discuss:
                <li>How generative AI can improve multi-agent learning, coordination, and real-world deployment.</li>
                <li>The role of cooperative AI in multi-agent motion prediction, end-to-end policy learning, and communication-efficient cooperation.</li>
                <li>The potential of large-scale datasets and benchmarks for advancing multi-agent cooperative learning.</li>
                <li>The security, privacy, and scalability challenges in data-driven cooperative robotics.</li> 
            </ul>

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2 mb-8 ml-4">
                We will invite leading researchers from academia and industry to present their latest findings, with a strong emphasis on real-world applications in swarm robotics, drone fleets, human-robot teams, and other AI-assisted cooperative systems. This ensures that attendees will engage with state-of-the-art methodologies and emerging paradigms in the field.
                To foster interaction and idea exchange, this workshop will include:
                <li>Keynote Talks ‚Äì Talks by top experts in multi-agent robotics, generative AI, and cooperative autonomy to highlight breakthrough research and open challenges.</li>
                <li>Interactive Poster & Lightning Talks ‚Äì Early-career researchers and PhD students will present emerging work, encouraging discussion and networking opportunities.</li>
                <li>Panel discussion ‚Äì Open-ended discussion on the future of cooperative robotics in the era of generative AI.</li>
                These elements ensure that participants are actively involved, gaining both theoretical knowledge and practical insights. We believe this workshop will expand IROS 2025's scope, attracting researchers from robotics, AI, and distributed systems, and fostering cross-disciplinary collaborations between academia and industry.
